**Total:** 1,186 lines, 51 code blocks across all files.

**What was done:**
- Rewrote `SKILL.md` (was a placeholder summary, now a proper skill file with YAML frontmatter, quick start examples, color system table, key rules, and cross-references)
- Validated all 5 reference files -- they were already comprehensive with real codebase examples, WARNING anti-patterns, DO/DON'T pairs, checklists, and cross-references to **globe-gl**, **three-js**, **d3**, and **websocket** skills
